I thought I wanted a job writing C++ because I'd "learn things" and "become a better programmer". As my career progressed from scientist-perpetually-in-training, to "data scientist", to "systems engineer", I became less intent on using a computer merely as a tool to accomplish a goal and more interested in the tool itself. I wanted to learn systems programming, understand how information flows at the lowest level, be a master of machines. At the same time, I wanted to be adept at programming probabilistic and physics-based simulations that require parallelism and speed that Python cannot provide. For some reason, I thought learning C++ would enable me to do this. I admit falling victim to a kind of misplaced, nerd equivalent of "machismo" that, in my mind, would be amplified by working with this notoriously difficult language. At least I thought so, until the finger bent on the monkey's paw and I got the job I wanted.

Seriously, though, it's not so bad. After programming in C++ for a few months, then having a chance to write some Python for an analysis script, I found myself missing strict typing a little; though I'd rarely used Python type hinting in my previous life as a data person, it now feels dirty not to. And, as a reminder that the Python ecosystem is not always nicer to use than C++, Pandas syntax is still terrible. (I'm told the cool kids have switched to Polars.)

As I'm learning (to appreciate) C++, I thought I'd start a collection of random notes, aphorisms, gotchas, and hate speech about C++, the broader dev ecosystem supporting it, or whatever else I find interesting. But I'm notorious for starting projects and dropping them a few days or weeks later. Trying to keep this informal and low pressure in hopes it will adapt to my shifting whimsy rather than be forever consigned to the rubbish bin when I run out of things to say about C++ or any specific topic.

QotD:
> Shocking and saddening that a newbie to the language has to know all of this just to do something as basic as initialise something.
